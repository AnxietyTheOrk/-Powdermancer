Main ideas, as of right now:
Guns that scale and evolve
Guns channeling modified spells.

Primary attribute: Int
Secondary Attribute: Dex

Spell list: TBD

Will include new guns with new models, made by me.
Will include new items, maybe new clothing (might need help with modeling for this, if anyone is interested when I get to this point.).
Will include new spells and passives relevant to the guns.
Will include new lore that I'll create for the class.
Will have subclasses, though I have yet to decide on what they will spec in.


Possible names for the class:
Powdermancer 
Magitechnician (Magitech Gunslinger)

Possible names for subclasses:
Gunwitch

Starting equipment (initial thoughts):
Gun (thinking a beaten up lever action rifle, that only holds maybe 3 shots)
Button up shirt
Pants
Boots
Book with intro lore to class (more will be available later in game) 


Current thoughts on clothing style and theme are rustic and magical combined. Think wild West with bright blues, reds, greens, purple. Colors and accents you'd expect on mage robes, but adjust for a western.
Example:
Slate grey hat and trench coat with ethereal blue embroidery and polished silver accents.
White button up shirt
Maybe dark pants and boots also with polished silver accents.
